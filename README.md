# ShoppingCart

This project has been developed by Taner BUYUKYILDIZ as a technical test.

STEP 1 :
  -The app takes in a list of Strings and uses the list to create a list of predefined cart item objects which implement the cartItem interface
  -Calculates the cost of the cart by going over the list and calling the getPrice() function using the java 8 stream api functions 
  

STEP 2 :
  -The app takes in a list of Strings and uses the list to create a map which uses the predefined cart item object as key and the count of it as the value
  -The app loops over the map to calculate the cost
  -The app then calculates the discount to be applied by using a map of offers which uses the predefined cart item class as key and the number of instances it requires to apply a free item discount.
